# Resource: aws_qldb_ledger

Provides an AWS Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB) resource

~> **NOTE:** Deletion protection is enabled by default. To successfully delete this resource via Terraform, `deletion_protection = false` must be applied before attempting deletion.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "aws_qldb_ledger" "sample-ledger" {
  name = "sample-ledger"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Optional) The friendly name for the QLDB Ledger instance. By default generated by Terraform.
* `deletion_protection` - (Optional) The deletion protection for the QLDB Ledger instance. By default it is `true`. To delete this resource via Terraform, this value must be configured to `false` and applied first before attempting deletion.
* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Name of the QLDB Ledger
* `arn` - The ARN of the QLDB Ledger
* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).

## Import

QLDB Ledgers can be imported using the `name`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import aws_qldb_ledger.sample-ledger sample-ledger
```
